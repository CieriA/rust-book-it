# Contributing to the italian translation

## Guidelines

When writing the translation of a file, always give a look at 
[translated terms](src/ch00-01-translated-terms.md), where you can find the correct translation
of some language specific terms to keep terminology consistent.

Try to stay accurate to the original english text.

### Translation

You should translate:
- text
- string text
- comments
- custom identifiers (**not** the ones from std library or other external crates)

You mustn't translate:
- terminal output (like the one produced by the compiler)
- file names
