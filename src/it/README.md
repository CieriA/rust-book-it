# Italian translation

Welcome to the italian version of the book!

The translation of the book is inside src/it/src/,
where there are the same files as in src/, but translated in italian.

I've decided to keep some terms in english, like `Ownership`, to ensure consistency
with the terminology used across the community, official documentation, and learning resources.

If someone learned `Ownership` as `Propriet√†`, reading something about ownership could
be not clear to them.
